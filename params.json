In Dohko, the users specify the applications and the requirements (e.g., number of CPU cores, maximal financial cost per hour, among others), and the system automatically (a) selects the resources (i.e., VMs) that meet the constraints; (b) configures and installs the applications in the clouds; (c) handles resource failures; and (d) executes the applications.","google":"UA-36587114-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
